  But <br> the <br> scariest <br> outcome <br> of <br> the <br> centralization <br> of <br> information <br> in <br> the <br> age <br> of <br> social <br> networks <br> is <br> something <br> else: <br> It <br> is <br> making <br> us <br> all <br> much <br> less <br> powerful <br> in <br> relation <br> to <br> governments <br> and <br> corporations. <br>
  Surveillance <br> is <br> increasingly <br> imposed <br> on <br> civilized <br> lives, <br> and <br> it <br>just <br> gets <br> worse <br> as <br> time <br> goes <br> by. <br> The <br> only <br> way <br> to <br> stay <br> outside <br> of <br> this <br> vast <br> apparatus <br> of <br> surveillance <br> might <br> be <br> to <br> go <br> into <br> a <br> cave <br> and <br> sleep, <br> even <br> if <br> you <br> canâ€™t <br> make <br> it <br> 300 <br> years.
  <br> Being <br> watched <br> is <br> something <br> we <br> all <br> eventually <br> have <br> to <br> get <br> used <br> to <br> and <br> live <br> with <br> and, <br> sadly, <br> it <br> has <br> nothing <br> to <br> do <br> with <br> the <br> country <br> of <br> our <br> residence. <br> Ironically <br> enough, <br> states <br> that <br> cooperate <br> with <br> Facebook <br> and <br> Twitter <br> know <br> much <br> more <br> about <br> their <br> citizens <br> than <br> those, <br> like <br> Iran, <br> where <br> the <br> state <br> has <br> a <br> tight <br> grip <br> on <br> the <br> Internet <br> but <br> does <br> not <br> have <br> legal <br> access <br> to <br> social <br> media <br> companies. <br>
  What <br> is <br> more <br> frightening <br> than <br> being <br> merely <br> watched, <br> though, <br> is <br> being <br> controlled. <br> When <br> Facebook <br> can <br> know <br> us <br> better <br> than <br> our <br> parents <br> with <br> only <br> 150 likes, <br> and <br> better <br> than <br> our <br> spouses <br> with <br> 300 <br> likes, <br> the <br> world <br> appears <br> quite <br> predictable, <br> both <br> for <br> governments <br> and <br> for <br> businesses. <br> And <br> predictability <br> means <br> control.
