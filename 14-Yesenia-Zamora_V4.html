  But the scariest <br>
  outcome of the centralization of <br>
  information in the age of social networks <br>
  is something else: It is making us all much less powerful <br>
  in relation to governments and corporations. Surveillance is increasingly <br>
  imposed on civilized lives, and it just gets worse as time goes <br>
  by. The only way to stay outside of this vast apparatus <br>
  of surveillance might be to go into a cave and <br>
  sleep, even if you canâ€™t make it 300 <br> years.
  Being watched is something <br>
  we all eventually <br>
  have to <br>
  get <br>
  used to <br>
  and live with and, <br>
  sadly, it has nothing to <br>
  do with the country of our residence. <br>
  Ironically enough, states that cooperate with Facebook <br>
  and Twitter know much more about their citizens than those, like Iran, <br>
  where the state has a tight grip on the Internet but does not <br>
  have legal access to social media companies. What is <br>
  more frightening than being merely watched, <br>
  though, is being controlled. When <br>
  Facebook can know us better <br>
  than our parents <br>
  with only <br>
  150 likes, and <br>
  better than our spouses <br>
  with 300 likes, the world appears <br>
  quite predictable, both for governments <br>
  and for businesses. And predictability means control.
