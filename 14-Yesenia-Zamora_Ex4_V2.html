<h5>
  But the scariest <br>
  outcome of the centralization <br>
  of information in the age of social networks <br>
  is something else: <br>
  It is making us all much less powerful <br>
  in relation to governments and corporations. <br>
  Surveillance is increasingly imposed on civilized lives, <br>
  and it just gets worse as time goes by. <br>
  The only way to stay outside of this vast apparatus of surveillance <br>
  might be to go into a cave and sleep, <br>
  even if you canâ€™t make it 300 years. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Being watched is something we all eventually have to get used to <br>
  and live with <br>
  and, sadly, it has nothing to do with the country of our residence. <br>
  <br> <br>
  Ironically enough, <br>
  states that cooperate with Facebook and Twitter <br>
  know much more about their citizens <br>
  than those, like Iran, where the state has a tight grip on the Internet <br>
  but does not have legal access to social media companies. <br>
  What is more frightening than being merely watched, though, <br>
  is being controlled. <br>
  When Facebook can know us better than our parents with only 150 likes, <br>
  and better than our spouses with 300 likes, <br>
  the world appears quite predictable, <br>
  both for governments and for businesses.<br>
  And predictability means control.
