    The article is emphasizing how algorithms are biased and are only taking account for a certain
    group of people. By having access to people's information the algorithm makes a guess about a person
    and what their interests are by gathering a very broad detail and making an assumption when it's not necessarily true.
    Because the internet is constantly collection data from other people,
    I wondered what it would be like if you got to see what other people were looking at instead
    of your own information. I thought of maybe when you go on someones social media page or if you
    clicked on that person's name in your contacts, you would get to see what their recommended ads were or
    what their browsing history was and from there a Christmas wishlist would be generated so you would
    "know exactly" what the person would want. I want to be looking at it from the other side to really get
    a sense of how invasive the internet is.
